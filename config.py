UPLOAD_FOLDER = 'images'
BASE_URL = 'https://aleksiatx-stage.onschrodinger.com' # Replace with your domain name https included. Define this in your app when using this code base. Only the test use it here,
IMAGE_DB = 'images.db'
PORT = '8100'
API_UPLOAD_URL = BASE_URL + '/livedesign/images/upload' # For Local Test Use 'http://127.0.0.1:8100/livedesign/images/upload'
# Note you will use the 127 localhost to test before nginx is configured. once nginx is good use the domain name. this may not work without nginx, I have not tested yet.
